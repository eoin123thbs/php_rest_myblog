THREE MAIN PARTS
i) Config Folder will hold our Database class -> used to  do core connection to mySQL using PDO.
WE've created the database; the class itself and within the database class, we made the connection object.

ii)		Models Folder; post model and category model.
Created on model for the Posts table - initialized the properties within - to represent the same in the table; id, category_id, title, created_at, etc.
Making a constructor which is one method/function made to run when the class is called/initialized
To create a Contructor: 'function __construct(){}' [double underscore]

When instantiating a new Post to the db we need to pass in the database object - then we want to set the connection of the post class to that DB parameter

iii) 	Frontend facing API folder -> Contain files that we'll hit in HTTP Client (postman)
